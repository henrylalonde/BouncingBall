# Bouncing Ball
##  **My first graphics program**

Created using **C++** and **SDL3**, this little demo program lets you use your mouse to control a circle on screen. There is another circle on the screen with simulated collisions, gravity, and friction. Run your mouse circle into the other circle to make it bounce around and go fast!
### **Riveting Gameplay**

## **How to Play**
- Download the BouncingBall.zip file from the latest release for your platform
- Unzip the contents (BouncingBall.exe and SDL3.dll) and run BouncingBall.exe. 
- Windows will probably say that it doesn't recognize the publisher, so if you trust me, press "Run Anyway".
