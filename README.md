# Bouncing Ball
##  **My first graphics program**

Created using **C++** and **SDL3**. This program allows you to:

- Control a ball using your mouse
- Bounce another ball around the screen

## **How to Play**
- Download the BouncingBall.zip file from the latest release for your platform
- Unzip the contents (BouncingBall.exe and SDL3.dll) and run BouncingBall.exe. 
- Windows will probably say that it doesn't recognize the publisher, so if you trust me, press "Run Anyway".
